## Why Like This?
Plugins and widgets can be awesome, when they work and play nice with the rest of your site. Often times you forced to pick and choose plugins only to find they have conflicts when loaded together. Or you never go back to the authors page and manually see if its been updated. Further more, do you need that plugin on every page?    

hui uses a slightly different plugin system than most other user interfaces. Instead of rolling your own one time version, we encourage you to take a more dynamic approach. Allowing you to easily integrate plugins, and keep a modular architecture.
   
Additionally, each plugin has a test suite, which allows you to target and problematical errors or conflicts a plugin may be having with your existing code.

## Updating Plugins
Updating Plugins is as easy as running "git update remote" on any of the plugins. If you have made changes, use the git command's built in stash feature to save your local changes.    

Basically, any of the cool stuff you can do with git is there. Fork, Push, Pull, and all the rest.
